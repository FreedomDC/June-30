### Questions

- What does `title` do?
Shows the name of the webpage
- What information do images need, and why?
Source and link
- What's the difference between `head` and `body`?
Title is usally in head and webpage is in body
- Based on the messages from the validator, write the bare minimum HTML you need to have a "valid" webpage.
